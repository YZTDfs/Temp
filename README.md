# :currency_exchange: General Management System   
>BrowserSide power by react   
>InterfaceSide power by koa2   
>The Electron version may be added in the future

:milky_way: This project originated with back-office management systems developed using the React on the job.When I developed the browser side and interface of the business system to 80%, I began to think, why not solidify these elements, such as: menu, navigation bar, user panel... Extract it, and when it's developed again, reduce the unnecessary work, and this thing is born. Of course, I admit that there is still a lot of room for improvement, especially since third-party components will be replaced further by independent components (I'm not saying, of course, that these third-party components are not good enough, especially antd is simply too damn easy to use), which is also an exercise for myself. As this thing matures, I'll use it in some open source businesses to detect this little guy. Below I will list some features that need to be developed/modified, both to improve the system and to urge myself not to be lazy.Of course, time is tight, I will prioritize the development of important functions, some usability changes may be slightly delayed, have fun!
